# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

Data source: Breast Cancer Center of Wisconsin

Developed from an online competition on Kaggle.com, the goal of this project is to take feature data to build a model to predict if a sample is malignant (cancerous) or benign (cancer-free). The model is built using a supervised machine learning approach, utilizing K-nearest-neighbor techniques. The model is simple in form and demonstrates a baseline understanding of utilizing machine learning models in python. Libraries and methods used include Sklearn, Numpy, & Pandas.
